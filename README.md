# Full Stack JavaScript Project 2

For this project, we had to turn an object array into a fully functional page with a search filter.

## The Brief
You'll start with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. You'll start by using your JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then you will add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

Your application will need to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. This means your solutions need to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.

## Outcome
The page has a background that changes gradient automatically and successfully shows the entire object array on the page. The filter also works correctly and ensures what you are typing in the search box appears on the page. Furthermore, a message appears on the screen if there are no students with the name you are searching for.
